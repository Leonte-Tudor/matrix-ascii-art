# matrix-ascii-art
An ascii art generator based on a matrix, its diagonals and a bit of arithmetic.

My first program in Rust. I would say it is *pure, memory-safe, backed by Google and papa Linus Rust*, but I'm not that deep in the cult yet.

Technically it is a unicode art generator, so keep that in mind when you run it.
